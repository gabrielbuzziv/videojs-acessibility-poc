# VideoJS Acessibility POC

We're working to improve acessibility of videos at Rocketseat, so we give some try on how we can do this to add Sign Language with a PIP modal video playing sync with the main video, we've already added captions and subtitles.

### To run this POC follow the steps:

```
npm install

This project will run on PORT `3000`!
